This project is based on movie genre prediction using python .The Movie Genre Prediction project uses Python helps to classify films into genres based on their plot summaries. Utilizing natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the project processes textual data, extracting features and employing machine learning algorithms to predict genres. It involves data collection, text preprocessing (tokenization, stemming, etc.), and feature extraction (TF-IDF, word embeddings). Various classifiers, such as logistic regression, random forests, and neural networks, are trained and evaluated for accuracy. The goal is to develop a model that accurately predicts the genre(s) of a movie, aiding in cataloging and recommendation systems.
